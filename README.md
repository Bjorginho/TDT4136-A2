## Implementation 
* The implementation and documentation of A* (astar) algorithm can be found in **Astar.py**
* **Node.py** is a helper class for keeping the location and costs of each cell on the map. 

## Results 
* The results of each task (the shortest paths) can be found as .png images in this folder. 
    * The shortest path are marked with black cells. 
    * Task 1: **path_task1.png**
    * Task 2: **path_task2.png**
    * Task 3: **path_task3.png**
    * Task 4: **path_task4.png**
    * We have not done Part 3 

## Test our code
* Change the task paramter on line 131 in **Astar.py**
